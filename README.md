# BoulderCorpusAnalysis
Code used for my final project in Corpus Linguistics to analyze deception based on the Boulder Lies and Truths Corpus.
This code was written to run on Python 2.7.

Before running the code, please make sure to acquire a legally licensed copy of the Boulder Lies and Truths Corpus, and to move the BLT-C_Boulder_Lies_and_Truths_Corpus.csv file to the same directory as ngramAnalysis.py and wordClustering.py. 

Simply run:
py ngramAnalysis

This will generate the top unigrams, bigrams, and results from the dominance score analysis. To then generate text files with the most associated word clusterings from the dominance score lists, run:
py wordClustering
